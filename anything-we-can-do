:: Build more renewable energy capacity {"position":"775,1700","size":"100,100"}
While it's tempting to think that there's no downside to keep building more renewable energy because it doesn't emit carbon, that's not the whole story. It still takes materials to build those windmills, solar panels and batteries, and those materials usually come from the Global South. Those communities are battling the negative consquences of mass extractivism, from biodiversity loss to poisoning of water supplies and air.

We must consider the impact of our energy needs on the whole world, and make sure we only build for what we truly need, especially as that will then ensure that other countries will also be able to cover their needs without overwhelming the Earth's supplies.

:: Carbon emissions from flying {"position":"500,3750","size":"100,100"}
The UK is one of the worst-offending countries in the world for carbon emissions from flying. Per-head, we emit more than 800kg per year, but it‚Äôs even worse when you take into account that 15% of people in the UK take 70% of all flights, while nearly half of our population does not fly at all in a given year. How should we address this?

Stop subsidising air travel, implement a Frequent Flyer Levy, and make up for this with significantly cheaper long-distance train services.

Nothing, we'll rely on new technologies (like Sustainable Aviation Fuel) to ensure flying doesn't add to emissions in the future

:: Decarbonise as quickly as possible [footer correct-answer] {"position":"500,2725","size":"100,100"}
Yes, exactly! As mentioned before, we have a huge historical responsibility for climiate change, so rapid action is needed.

These industries either do very little to add to the real economy of our country (even suppressing it in the case of finance<sup>1</sup>), or cause a huge amount of fossil fuel emissions. Tourism also increases the need for us to grow or import more food to support high numbers of visitors to the country each year.

Workers would be given opportunities to train (fully-paid!) for good jobs in decarbonisation, like the retrofitting schemes we discussed earlier, or in the other industries that we need to ramp up quickly.

It's a common misconception, but most innovation doesn‚Äôt come from private individuals or businesses. There are countless studies that show us how most innovation is de-risked by government funding and then private companies/wealthy individuals get to cream off all the benefit<sup>1</sup>. 

So we don't need these wealthy people, and we most certainly don't need their tax money to run our public services, but if they're going to stay here in the UK then we want to make sure we massively reduce their outsize impact on the climate and on the power their money gives them in our political system.

You‚Äôve fallen into the worst traditional economics trap of them all üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

This is truly one of the most pernicious beliefs of traditional economic thinking - that if wages keep up with inflation, that will then push prices even higher, causing firms and workers to fight against each other and making the inflation even worse than it would otherwise have been.

There is very little evidence that this has ever happened in history - even the IMF found that the inflation of the 1970s was found to be primarily driven by skyrocketing oil prices (due to limited supply) and not further excerbated by the union-negotiated wage increaes that followed that inflation<sup>1</sup>. The inflation was eased due to increased oil supply in the 1980s, and not because of the heavy-handed union busting tactics of conservative leaders like Margaret Thatcher.

Another case in point is Belgium, where wages are indexed to inflation by law, and which has never experienced a wage-price spiral.

Let's bury this myth once and for all and do things differently.

You‚Äôve fallen into the traditional economics trap üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

Back when you used to be able to exchange UK pounds for gold (what's commonly known as the gold standard), it‚Äôs true that you would have to find more gold to back the additional spending that you want to do. Otherwise you would run the risk of people wanting to convert those new pounds you created into gold at the agreed exchange rate, and you wouldn't have enough to pay them all.

But since the 1970s we‚Äôve had a fiat currency<sup>1</sup>, which means that the currency isn‚Äôt convertible at a fixed rate to gold or anything else, and the government has more flexibility over how much money is available to our economy. This means that like Keynes said: "Anything we can actually do, we can afford". For more information, click the icon in the top right to learn all about Modern Monetary Theory.

:: Find out more about where the inflation is coming from [correct-answer] {"position":"450,750","size":"100,100"}
This is the right call! There‚Äôs two main kinds of inflation - cost push and demand pull. The methods to fight these are different.

For demand pull, this is the traditional "too much money chasing too few goods and services" situation that economists often try to cool with interest rate hikes. This type of inflation rarely happens, but if it does, then a more targeted approach would be to try to reduce demand on the specific sector causing the increase (e.g. if it's petrol prices, make public transport free or low cost). 

For cost push, interest rate hikes don't work at all. You have to target the actual issues causing the costs to increase - for example, when the economy picked up again a few months into the Covid pandemic, there were bottlenecks in the supply chain where ports weren't processing containers quickly enough because they were making so much money having increased prices for each container so much. The US imposed a tax for containers sitting empty on the docks, which caused them to increase the rate of processing again, and improved supply of goods to the economy.

So let's find out more about the source of the inflation!

:: Fossil fuel companies will decarbonise [footer] {"position":"750,1425","size":"100,100"}
It would be nice if this were really true, but we cannot rely on the private sector to decarbonise at the rate we need - even the Financial Times says that "Capitalism won‚Äôt deliver the energy transition fast enough"<sup>1</sup>. The financial returns from renewables are so much lower than fossil fuels, because once you‚Äôve set up the site, then the fuel that powers the generation (wind and sun) is literally free. Fossil fuels (and nuclear/hydrogen) cost far more to run because you‚Äôre constantly paying for more fuel.

Governments literally have to guarantee prices far higher for renewables than they would actually cost to run, to make it worth the while for private companies to decide to bid for renewable energy contracts (and if set the maximum bids too low, this has resulted in no private companies wanting to make offers<sup>2</sup>). A public energy provider would not have to make a profit - its only goal would be to make sure the UK meets its decarbonisation goals and provides cheaper energy.

Let's try something different.

:: Implement a suite of taxes targeting wealth and inequality [correct-answer] {"position":"500,3275","size":"100,100"}
Absolutely right - we can implement a wealth tax, but the rich are really good at getting around those, so we'll probably need to implement a suite of taxes that target all the ways in which the wealthy earn and hoard more than their fair share. The following are an incomplete list of ideas that we could implement:

Reform tax laws to ensure that unearned income (dividends, capital gains, etc) is taxed at the same levels as earned income like wages

Abolish regressive National Insurance contributions, which mean that higher-rate taxpayers contribute a lower proportion of their salary than those on the lower rate (2% above the higher rate of tax threshold, versus 12% below)

Make inheritance tax more progressive - rather than a flat rate across all income, increase it rapidly above say ¬£10 million

Impose a maximum income ratio of 10:1 on all companies, such that the highest-paid worker cannot earn more than 10 times that of the lowest worker (so either you have to increase wages at the bottom, or lower wages at the top).

Reform council tax bands based on size of property and house prices (once the market has adjusted to lower prices, due to housing no longer being a commodity) such that really large houses pay a lot more than smaller ones

We don't need this money to fund other social programs, but reducing inequality is important so that the rich don't have too much power over others.

:: Job guarantee [footer correct-answer] {"position":"500,3600","size":"100,100"}
Yes! This is a key part of ensuring that the economy stays stable and that everyone has access to their basic needs. A Job Guarantee scheme would be centrally funded, but locally administered, such that local communities could have influence over the kinds of jobs that their local areas would benefit from.

The main advantage of schemes like this one is that it would provide a good baseline for all working conditions in the economy - the wage would be set at a good living wage, with no zero-hours contracts or unstable working conditions allowed. And it acts as an inflation stabiliser - instead of raising interest rates when inflation increases, which just puts people out of work to reduce demand in the economy, people are provided with an inflation-linked living wage such that they can still afford their bills when the private economy is struggling.

Finally this is such a great policy because it ensures that the jobs will be created where the people already are, rather than forcing people to move for opportunities. Informal care jobs like spending time with the elderly or isolated (not professional care jobs, which would be highly trained and even better remunerated), ecosystem restoration or jobs in non-profits could all be roles in which Job Guarantee roles would be available.

:: Make housing a human right [correct-answer] {"position":"500,2175","size":"100,100"}
This is exactly the right principle to be keeping in mind when designing policies for housing in the UK - housing is a human right. There are many things that could be done here - you could cap maximum rents to a proportion of average wages in each area, cap annual rent increases and implement heavy taxes on second homes and empty homes, for example.

In order to combat the likely decrease in house prices, given that housing would be less profitable, you could offer to remortgage anyone's property that now is worth less than what they paid for it (providing a 30-year fixed mortgage in a publicly-owned bank).

Knowing what you do about where money comes from in the UK, you could go even further with your government's spending power to buy up existing housing stock from landlords who no longer want to rent under the new rules, and turn them into council housing - or even better, set up community wealth funds to purchase the housing, so that future governments without the people's interest in mind can't choose to sell the housing stock back off again.

Finally you can build more social housing appropriate to people‚Äôs needs, in communities where all essentials are available within 15min walk or public transport - but the priority should be to ensure that the housing we do have is being used in the most socially-benefical ways.

Money's origin isn't rooted in widespread barter as commonly believed. Societies historically pooled resources, with people contributing based on ability and receiving based on needs, so neither barter nor money was used.

Money emerged to incentivise larger and less well-acquainted groups of people to do things - for example, when rulers sent their armies on long campaigns, rather than having to bring all their supplies with them, they imposed taxes on the people living in the land through which they passed. 

To earn the money to pay those taxes, the people could give some of their food to the passing armies, or give them accommodation for the night.

In other words, the state uses its power to impose a tax on the people living in it, thereby creating unemployment and requiring people to work to pay that tax. And in order for the people to be able to earn the currency, the state has to create it in the first place - so it must spend money into the economy (i.e. by giving the money to its armies to give to the people who provide them with food and shelter) before it can collect it back in tax.

And if the state spends more than it taxes back (what‚Äôs known as a deficit ‚Äî the opposite would be a surplus), this allows people to save, or to exchange that money with other people for goods and services - in other words, a state deficit is a good thing for us. The only risk comes if the state puts too much money into an area where there‚Äôs already a lot of competition for resources - this is what might lead to inflation (which you‚Äôll learn more about in the game).

One other important thing is that this only works if you have monetary sovereignty - that is you don‚Äôt have a fixed exchange rate to any other currency or commodity, and you have little to no debt in foreign currencies. This is not the case for many Global South countries, so we should be fighting to cancel their foreign debts and help them achieve this.

This is definitely not the only way to run an economy - perhaps in an ideal world, we wouldn‚Äôt need money at all. But for now it‚Äôs what we have, so it‚Äôs important to know the rules and make sure everyone can thrive in this system.

Yes! This is an exciting option already proposed by many, including the New Economics Foundation<sup>1</sup>. The reference goes into the specifics of the scheme in much more detail, but this would treat energy provision more like the NHS, as a basic need for all. 

By providing everyone's basic needs for free, and then increasing costs progressively as energy usage rises, it would also incentivise reductions in usage for richer households that are using more power (and should include social tariffs/subsidies for any poorer households that lose out with the higher prices).

Excellent choice! If the state owns the generation capability, it doesn‚Äôt need it to make a profit - it can invest what‚Äôs needed in this essential productive capacity, and then the UK population gets the benefit of the cheaper energy. That said, the cost of raw materials for renewables has skyrocketed recently, so the government should also explore ways to get alternative, post-growth supply chains for what it needs.

The 2024 example of Tata Steel pulling out of Port Talbot in Wales<sup>1</sup> is a prime example of how the government could pivot ventures that private companies think are unprofitable into nationalised post-growth companies that would prioritise green steel manufacturing, only to meet the actual needs of the energy transition (and other non-planet-destroying ventures).

:: Raise interest rates to cool demand {"position":"675,625","size":"100,100"}
You‚Äôve fallen into the traditional economics trap üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

Raising interest rates is supposed to help with inflation by making unemployment go up because businesses can‚Äôt afford to borrow money to hire more people any more. The idea is that this would weaken wages and worker power, because there would be fewer jobs to go around.

However this is an incredibly untargeted approach and rarely if ever has the desired effect. It is a cruel policy to intentionally target unemployment, and causes incredible stress for renters and homeowners who are now suddenly facing large increases in their monthly housing payments.

And furthermore, because at the moment there's lots of money in the economy, it actually creates the opposite effect - the stock market has been going up since the interest rate increases, because higher interest rates funnel money to people who already have money, enabling them to invest even more and further widening inequality.

Interest rate increases are untargeted and ineffective, and should not be used to control inflation. Go back to see how we could be doing all of this differently.

Absolutely the right call.

The cost of the strikes to the wellbeing and health of the country is not worth some power struggle, and you know you have the money. The previous government spent far more mitigating the cost of the strikes than they would have spent to meet the needs of the union, so you know an approach like theirs was a cruel waste of time.

You can implement automatic stabilisers like automatically-adjusting tax bands based on any excessive wage growth over inflation to proactively address any demand pull inflation that might come in as a result, but there's very little risk of this happening based on historical drivers to inflation.

This is a fantastic policy - it will put more money back into people's pockets, and will help better connect rural communities and cities outside of London alike. The UK public transport network has been extensively privatised and is run in the interests of profit, not service. So rather than giving subsidies to private companies, the government can re-nationalise these services, improving wages and increasing the desirability of these jobs in the local communities.

We'd quickly overwhelm the Earth's resources if we tried to replace every petrol car out there with an electric equivalent. But if we make public transportation a true alternative to owning a car, we can persuade people to ditch their private vehicles and greatly reduce the total amount of resources that we need to give everyone a good life.

We‚Äôre a long way away from any feasible technology that will significantly reduce airline emissions as much as we need - there's no evidence that the airline industry will be able to create biofuels like Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at even the scale currently needed, and the demand for airline travel is increasing all the time. 

Unproven technologies like this can't be our solution for the biggest crisis facing our planet - we need to cut our emissions by about half between here and 2030<sup>1</sup>, so there's no time. And SAF doesn't even completely cut emissions; it reduces them to about 80% of what they are now.

On top of that, other the Jevons paradox<sup>2</sup> shows that when a new techonology is developed that reduces emissions, the rebound effect from lower prices and people feeling like they can now use that new technology without worrying means that we will constantly be trying to reach a finish line that's moving away from us.

See the excellent factsheets<sup>3</sup> at Stay Grounded for more details on why the airline industry is so dangerous for our planet, and why the greenwashing from airline industries must be disregarded.

Go back and let's see what kind of action is needed instead.

:: Retrofitting and heat pump rollout [footer correct-answer] {"position":"500,1300","size":"100,100"}
This is exactly the kind of ambition we need in the UK. Our historical responsibility for climate change over our ‚Äúfair share‚Äù (based on our population size) is 7%, the 4th largest in the world<sup>1</sup>. We have to decarbonise as fast as we can in order to give space for poorer countries, who have historically contributed very little to the climate crisis and may need to grow their emissions before they can decarbonise.

But that expense shouldn‚Äôt fall on individuals, which is why we must provide grants to make this happen (and as you now know, this is something the government can absolutely afford). It‚Äôs true that we‚Äôll be giving grants to the wealthy here too, but we have other plans to address their wealth (and these grants are a drop in the ocean for them).

Finally to keep an eye on inflation, we‚Äôll need to make sure we have enough labour for this project, and that we can produce enough of the heat pumps and retrofitting materials (or import them). The training programs (offering a good salary from the very start) will attract workers from precarious gig work and the armed forces. If there‚Äôs competition for the actual materials required from the private sector, with the potential to drive up inflation, we can enact emergency powers to ramp up production, or ensure that the government gets first right of refusal on those goods, at the price before the program was announced.

Let's keep going!

:: Set up Citizen‚Äôs Assembly networks [correct-answer] {"position":"450,475","size":"100,100"}
You have the right instincts - our current system of representative politics doesn't result in popular policies (such as the re-nationalisation of our public services) becoming reality. By making our democracy more participatory, we‚Äôll make sure that these important policies are prioritised by government, while ensuring people feel more connected to their communities and more in control of their lives.

We could set these up via sortition (so any adult in the country could be selected to be part of the assembly), setting terms for a period of several years. It would also be important to train and pay people to participate, so any inequalities up until now are not exacerbated in this process, as well as minimising financial hardship from not working.

From here on in, let‚Äôs assume that the choices you‚Äôre making are on policy areas that the public are raising as those that need to be addressed, and that they‚Äôve had a chance to input their thoughts into what the solutions should be ‚ú® let‚Äôs keep going!

:: Source of the inflation {"position":"450,875","size":"100,100"}
The economist team tells you that the biggest contributor to inflation right now is coming from high energy prices. How will you respond?

Launch a national energy guarantee, providing everyone‚Äôs essential energy needs for free and ramping up costs for any excessive usage over that.

Implement a windfall tax on the energy providers.

:: Stop subsidising air travel [correct-answer] {"position":"500,3925","size":"100,100"}
Exactly right - while the aviation industry isn't the most polluting one overall (causing "only" 5.9% of human contributions to global heating up until now<sup>1</sup>), it's both one of the fastest-growing ones and one of the hardest to decarbonise.

Airline travel is so mind-bogglingly cheap right now due to the subsidies and tax relief it receives from governments around the world. We could end all this in the UK by properly taxing airline fuel, and adding a carbon tax on top of that of at least ¬£100/tonne (so a return flight London to NYC would have about ¬£100 added)<sup>2</sup>.

Additionally to make sure that the richest travel less without too-heavily penalising lower-income people, we should implement a Frequent Flyer levy - the first flight per person per year would not have a charge, but after that a charge would be applied, doubling for each additional flight<sup>3</sup>.

Alongside that, we should heavily subsidise long-distance train travel, re-nationalising the whole service and improving the infrastructure (e.g. completing the new HS2 rail project to free up capacity for services to the North, better service that doesn't require connections through London, increasing the number of cross-Channel trains, etc). It's understanable that people fly instead of taking the train right now, due to how much cheaper it is, so we have to make the choice to take the train much easier.

Well done, let's keep going.

People are struggling to afford what they need because inflation is high and their wages are not keeping up. What do you do?

Tell your economists to find out more about where the inflation is coming from before taking action

Raise interest rates to cool demand and therefore reduce the rate of price increase

:: Tackling the housing crisis {"position":"500,2050","size":"100,100"}
The improvements you've made to energy costs with the energy guarantee and nationalised energy provider are a huge success; people have more disposable income to afford other essentials. 

However, housing is still a huge part of people‚Äôs expenditure and often extremely hard to find. How can you help improve this situation?

:: Tax breaks for people to save money in their pensions {"position":"750,2875","size":"100,100"}
This isn't the fairest approach. Firstly this only rewards people who already have money and can invest some of that in the stock market. And secondly, this would keep care in the private market, which is primarily trying to make a profit and therefore is not prioritising the best service for the country.

Relying on savings growing in the private markets also keeps us entrenched in the cycle of growth - people don't get the money they need unless the stock market grows, and if there's a crash like the one in 2008, people's ability to live off their pensions will be hugely diminished.

We need a kinder, fairer system that doesn't exacerbate the existing inequalities in our country, so let's try again.

:: UK decarbonisation {"position":"500,2600","size":"100,100"}
The UK has been a huge net contributor to the climate crisis, as one of the first countries to industrialise. How will this influence your policies?

It's a motivation to go as quickly as possible - for example we should quickly reduce high-carbon sectors like the aviation, finance and tourism sectors, to free those people up for well-paid jobs in decarbonisation and low-carbon professions like the public transport, health and care sectors. 

It's a factor, but other countries like China produce emissions that are much bigger than ours now, so while we should still decarbonise, we're not the biggest priority.

:: Universal Care Service [correct-answer] {"position":"500,3000","size":"100,100"}
This is a great choice - you'll pay really good wages for these jobs, and ensure that the hours aren't too onerous for what can be very demanding work, so that you can easily attract workers away from the existing private care sector and relieve the incredibly overloaded social workers who provide these kinds of services already. 

You can even offer to buy existing private care homes up so that you have ready-made care facilities, and again could consider putting all of these new assets into Community Wealth Funds such that the people would decide their future, so they can't be sold off to private firms by a future government.

Without the need to hoard homes as assets for retirement, you'll further reduce demand on the private housing market as these homes get transferred into community hands.

Moving on!

:: Windfall tax on the energy providers {"position":"700,875","size":"100,100"}
It's tempting to go for an approach like this, but it's not necessarily one that materially helps anyone. 

Yes this reduces the energy providers' profits, and also has the effect of reducing the amount of money they can redistribute to their shareholders, but nothing will change regarding the soaring amounts of money that people have to pay for their energy. And ultimately the companies may just pass on higher costs to their customers.

Finally as we know from Modern Monetary Theory, taxes don‚Äôt subsequently fund spending, so all that will happen is that this money will disappear from circulation.

Go back and try something more adventurous!
