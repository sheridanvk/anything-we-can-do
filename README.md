This project holds the source code for the game "Anything we can actually do, we can afford", avaolable at https://youreconomy.uk

Thanks to the following open source projects used in this game:
- [Twine open-source software package](https://github.com/klembot/twinejs), developed by Chris Klimas (@klembot).
  - Custom Javascript- and CSS-based functionality was added on top to make it more of a standalone application. 
- Fonts are hosted by Google: [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather) for paragraph text, and [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) for headings.
- The [confetti effect](https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti) is by Kiril Vatev (@catdad).
- The carousel component on mobile is from the [Bootstrap library](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/carousel/).
- The “sustainable pound” logo was designed by me, using vector graphics from [vectordad.com](https://vectordad.com/designs/floral-svg/?expand_article=1)https://vectordad.com/designs/floral-svg/?expand_article=1.
